welcome = "Welcome to *Mbtie*, an anonymous chatbot for dating and making friends based on an MBTI matching algorithm\. \
This bot seeks to address what tinder fails to do \
â€” *forge meaningful relationships*\. It does so in three ways:\n\n*1\. Anonymous chat*: \
Users do not get to see each others' profile pictures, hence allowing conversations to be more genuine and less shallow\.\n\n*2\. \
One chat at a time*: The bot only permits each person to have one conversation at a time, thereby allowing users to focus their attention on their one match\.\n\n*3\.\
MBTI matching algorithm*: The Myers Briggs Type Indicator is a well\-known personality profiling instrument that categorizes people into 16 different personality\
types based on how they perceive the world and make decisions\. The bot will match you with others who have a compatible personality \
type\.\n\n*Use these commands to control the bot:*\n/setup \- Setup or configure your profile\n/start \- Start matching\!\n/stop \- End the chat\n/ttol \- Play 2 Truth 1 Lie \
!\n/tiktok \- Play TikTok Battle\!\n/topic \- Play MBTI Topics\!\n/report \- Report a user for any misconduct\.\n/feedback \- tell us how we can improve the bot\!"
