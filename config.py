welcome = "Welcome to *MBTInder Bot SG*, an anonymous chatbot for dating and making friends based on an MBTI matching algorithm\. While MBTInder is a portmanteau of MBTI and Tinder, it seeks to address what tinder failed to do â€” *forge meaningful and strong relationships*\. It does so in three ways:\n\n*1\. Anonymous chat*: Users do not get to see each others' profile pictures, hence allowing conversations to be more genuine and less shallow\.\n\n*2\. One chat at a time*: The bot only permits each person to have one conversation at a time, thereby allowing users to focus their attention on their one match\.\n\n*3\. MBTI matching algorithm*: The Myers Briggs Type Indicator is a well\-known personality profiling instrument that categorizes people into 16 different personality types based on how they perceive the world and make decisions\. The bot will match you with others who have a compatible personality type\.\n\nUse these commands control the bot:\n\n/setup \- Setup or configure your profile\n/start \- start matching with someone\n/icebreaker \- send a 2 Truth 1 Lie poll to your match\!\n/help \- for more info on how to use the bot\."
